# Circle Card Custom Visual

![Circle Card](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/media/custom-visual-develop-tutorial/circle-developer-visual.png)

This repository represents a simple way to use Power BI Custom Visuals Tools. Circle Card shows singular value inside a circle. It supports basic visual settings (color and circle thickness) and adaptability to viewport size.

Custom Visual development basics are explained in [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/custom-visual-develop-tutorial). It describes step-by-step creation of Circle Card. You're welcome to use that example as a base to your own Custom Visuals by cloning this repository or using `pbiviz new` command of [Power BI Visuals Tools](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals-tools).
